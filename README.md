# Learning about Version Control
Author : Abdul Safdar

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is that it allows you to keep track of your progress and keep track of changes you made.

What I don't like is when there are merge conflicts and they are difficult to deal with, it can be difficult to figure out what is conflicting, and sometimes when I tried to stash my changes, then pulled any changes a group member made, it would break my ipynb file.
